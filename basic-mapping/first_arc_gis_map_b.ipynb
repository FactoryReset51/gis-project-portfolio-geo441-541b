It's not super difficult to import data into a project and the layers panel on the left side of the screen keeps everything well organized. I think this is one of the easier aspects of the software, at least working with only a few layers as in this assignment.\n",
        "  - Map creation and annotation\n",
        "    - I found map creation to be slightly challenging due to the Map Frame feature. The frame didn't always encompass the whole map or specific features that I wanted to showcase. Changing the shape of the frame resulted in movement of the map in addition, which made that process frustrating at times. Otherwise, adding map features such as the legend, title, or scale bar was pretty simple and didn't pose much trouble.\n",
        "  - Navigate the software using its GUI\n",
        "    - The software was fairly easy to navigate. The GUI is well-organized with the different tabs and I was usually able to find the function I was looking for quickly. When I wasn't able to, the search bar serviced just as well in locating the function I needed."
